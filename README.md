A to do list, but better.

The To-DON'T List app is presently still in its very early stages.

This was born from the typical beginner developer app, the To Do list. I immediately went in to this knowing that I wanted to do something different with it.
After intense thought I decided to take the route of the internet jargon using the word 'don't'. Using the context of expressing to someone to not do something.
If an individual is doing something you do not approve of the correct expression in English could be 'can you not?' which is short for, 'can you not do that?'. Or 'please don't' which is short for 'please don't do that'.
Whereas using 'don't' those expressions are combined into 'can you don't?' While 'not' is a adverb and 'dont' is a contraction both words give the same inference. 

Taking the usage a step further you could also say, 'don'ting', or 'I'm don'ting'. The translation being 'not doing that', or 'I'm not doing that'. 
It can also be used in the proclamation of an individual whom is refusing an offering, or a task. Using 'don't' you could say, 'I'm gonna don't', or 'Yeah, I'm gonna don't'.
